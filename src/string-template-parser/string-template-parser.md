# String template parser

This is a copy if https://github.com/souldreamer/string-template-parser
because [it does not support ESM](https://github.com/souldreamer/string-template-parser/issues/2).
I disabled ESLint and added some //@ts-ignore because I don't want to deal with this code
and I want to use this package when the issue is resolved (or I will fork it and do my own version)
